# Predicting diabetes based on diagnostic measures

### Abstract:

Diabetes occurs when a body is unable to generate or react correctly to insulin which is wanted to regulate glucose. This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. Machine Learning is key technique to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Therefore, the algorithms used in this project are Na√Øve Bayes Classifier, Back Propagation Network, and Logistic Regression. Depending on the algorithm and model used we can get wildly different results.
